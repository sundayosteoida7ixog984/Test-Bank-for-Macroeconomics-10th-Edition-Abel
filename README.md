Demonstrating a balanced treatment of both classical and Keynesian economics, Macroecomomicspresents macroeconomic theory in a big-picture way. Comprehensive coverage makes it easy for instructors to align chapters to fit their own syllabi, and the text helps students analyze real macroeconomic data used by policy makers and researchers. This text takes a unified approach based on a single economics model that provides students with a clear understanding of macroeconomics and its classical and Keynesian assumptions. The 10th Edition features new applications, boxes, and problems throughout. It also reflects recent events and developments in the field, such as the recent crisis in the US and Europe and the many new tools used by the Federal Reserve in response
